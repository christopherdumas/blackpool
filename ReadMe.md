BlackPool
=========

BlackPool is an attempt to implement a web application framework 
similar to Seaside for Smalltalk. It is 'heretic' in that, like Seaside, it
does not follow the widely accepted RESTful approach to web development.

**Note:** You will need and Io implementation with Sockets/Volcano support.

There are two examples in the `samples/` directory. You can start the
application by running it's server file, which you will find in the
application's home directory.

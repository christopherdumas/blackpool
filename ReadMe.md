BlackPool
=========

BlackPool is (or will be) an attempt to implement a web application framework 
similar to Seaside for Smalltalk. It is 'heretic' in that, like Seaside, it
does not follow the widely accepted RESTful approach to web development.

This is very much a work in progress, the framework is currently intertwined
with a simple application while it is being developed. The main framework
code lives in `lib`, the simple demonstration application is in `app`.

You will need and Io implementation with Sockets/Volcano support, running
`io todo.io` should start the demo app, which you can interact with at
`http://localhost:8090`.
